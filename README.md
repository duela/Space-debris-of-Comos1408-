GABBARD DIAGRAMS
In this practical, you have to read the TLEs contained in the file Cosmos1408.txt and create a Gabbard
diagram. In the 𝑥𝑥 axis, you should put the orbital period, and in the 𝑦𝑦 axis the apogee and the perigee (see
examples in the course slides).
The period is obtained as 𝑃𝑃=2𝜋𝜋􀶨𝑎𝑎3𝜇𝜇
where 𝑎𝑎 is the semi-major axis (obtained from the TLE file), and 𝜇𝜇=3.986004×1014 m3/s2 is the Earth’s
gravitational parameter.
The apogee and perigee are calculated as 𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝=𝑎𝑎(1−𝑒𝑒) 𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎=𝑎𝑎(1+𝑒𝑒)
being 𝑒𝑒 the orbital eccentricity (again, obtained from the Cosmos1408.txt file).
